**Data Logic (Per Manager, Per Week):**

- **Actual Record**: Wins/losses based on real starting lineup vs opponent  
- **Best Case Record**: Highest-scoring *valid* lineup (1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 FLEX, 1 K, 1 DST) each week → re-simulate win/loss  
- **Worst Case Record**: Lowest-scoring *valid* lineup each week → re-simulate win/loss  
- **Max Points**: Sum of best possible lineup scores across all 10 weeks  
- **Actual Points**: Sum of points from actual starters  
- **Bench Points Lost**: Max Points – Actual Points  
- **Games Flippable**: Number of losses that would’ve been wins with optimal lineup
