                            But still it lingered near.<br><br>

                            And waited patiently about,<br>

                            And waited patiently about,<br>
                            Till Mary did appear.<br><br>

                            "Why does the lamb love Mary so?"<br>
                            Love Mary so? Love Mary so?<br>
                            "Why does the lamb love Mary so?"<br>
                            The eager children cry.<br><br>

                            "Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know,"<br>
